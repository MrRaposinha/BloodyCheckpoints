# Bloody Checkpoints

**Bloody Checkpoints** is a mod for ULTRAKILL aimed at casual players who prefer a less punishing gameplay experience. It modifies the checkpoint system to fully restore the player's health whenever a checkpoint is activated, offering a smoother and more accessible journey through ULTRAKILL's challenging levels.

## üåü Features

- **Full Health Restoration**: Every time you activate a checkpoint, your health is fully restored.
- **Supports Bonus Health**: If you've collected temporary bonus health (up to 200), it will be preserved after interacting with a checkpoint.
- **Casual-Friendly Gameplay**: Designed to make the game less punishing without removing the thrill of combat.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

ULTRAKILL's default checkpoint system saves your progress but doesn‚Äôt restore your health, making it more difficult to recover from mistakes. **Bloody Checkpoints** changes this by:
- Detecting when the player activates a checkpoint.
- Fully restoring the player's health up to their current maximum (including temporary bonus health).
- Providing a more forgiving experience while maintaining the fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping gameplay ULTRAKILL is known for.
